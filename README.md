# Anycubic-Predator-Duet
Config files for the Anycubic Predator Duet
My machine is stock except for the controller board.
Therefore, you should be able to upload these config files and be sorted.
The only wiring changes I have made to my machine is to run an extra cable for the fans to separate them into two plugs.
I will try and keep this repo up to date as I tweak my machine further.
